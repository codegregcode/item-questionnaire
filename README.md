# Item questionnaire

Where I work I feel like we're wasting a lot of money sending prepaid postage labels to people that don't intend to use the service or don't have the right/enough items to send to us to make any money or break even.

This app intends to take the users personal information (name, address, email, phone) as well as information about the items that they want to send us. Items the user adds to their order/lead will generate a rating high/med/low/no.

This rating will dictate whether A - a pack is sent out and booking form emailed (induction call) [high], B - a digital brochure and a booking form is sent to the user [med/low], C - a digital brochure sent [no].
